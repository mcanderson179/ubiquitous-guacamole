# Mac M1

<br>
  For my cybersecurity course it was recommended that I purchase and use a mini pc for the length of the course. I did get one but I enjoyyed using my mac so much that I would rather use it for most things so I found myself trying to find workarounds for things that weren't easy to do in MacOS. This has taught me a lot about the M1 arm64 architecture and hopefully what I've learned could help someone else like me.

Firstly

## Homebrew packages

Honestly I don't remember installing all these packages. Most are likely installed as dependencies. Packages that I needed for various things include:
[aria2](https://aria2.github.io/ "Aria2's Homepage") <br>
[libvert](https://libvirt.org/ "Libvert's Homepage") <br>
[qemu](https://www.qemu.org/ "Qemu's Homepage") <br>
[git](https://git-scm.com/ "Git's Homepage") <br>
[virt-manager](https://virt-manager.org/ "Virt-Manager's Homepage") <br>
